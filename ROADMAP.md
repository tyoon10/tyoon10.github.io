## Personal Brand Strategy

Synthesized from career advising (Irene Papajohn, CMC) and capstone advising (Hugh Thomas, Columbia Engineering) sessions.

### Core Positioning

**The bridge between AI platforms and enterprise finance.**

Not a pure engineer. Not a pure MBA. The rare candidate who has built AI systems, run enterprise go-to-market at Anthropic, and understands financial services from the inside (IB background, CFA, quant research).

### The Hiring Manager Test

Hugh Thomas: *"If you're inside a company that's going to hire you, why would they hire you? What's the thing that you can do for me that nobody else can?"*

**Answer:** You can walk into a bank, understand their problems in their language, translate those into AI product requirements, and bring them back to the LLM platform — because you've done investment banking, built AI pipelines, and run enterprise go-to-market for Anthropic. That combination is rare.

### Brand Assets (Ranked by Signal Strength)

| Asset | Signal | How to Leverage on Site |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **Anthropic** (current) | 90% of inbound interest on LinkedIn. Enterprise AI credibility. | Lead with it in org affiliations. Frame all Claude workshop/hackathon work as enterprise go-to-market execution. |
| **Manus AI Fellow** | Agentic AI is the narrative of 2025-26. Enterprise focus. Meta acquisition adds validation. | Highlight in bio. Frame as enterprise agentic AI leadership, not just "fellowship." |
| **AI Club Co-President** | Community builder. 300→600+ growth. Enterprise event programming. | Frame as go-to-market execution at scale, not "student club leadership." |
| **AI pipeline builder** (MathWorks) | Shows you build, not just strategize. Presented to 200+ industry professionals. | Project case study. Lead with "built a novel AI pipeline" not "presented at conference." |
| **Finance background** (IB, CFA) | Domain expertise that AI companies need but can't easily hire for. | Weave into every project/post. You don't just build AI — you build AI for finance. |

### Key Messaging Rules

1. **Anthropic first, Columbia second.** The Anthropic brand opens more doors than the MBA. Lead with it.
2. **"Built" over "presented."** Irene: *"I don't care that you presented. I care that you built this AI pipeline."* Every description should start with what you built.
3. **Enterprise framing always.** Not "AI workshops" → "Enterprise AI adoption workshops for finance professionals." Not "hackathon" → "NYC's largest student AI hackathon with enterprise sponsors."
4. **Succinct = confident.** Irene: *"Being more succinct is a very strong signal of confidence."* Apply to all site copy. Short sentences. No filler.
5. **Finance as the domain, not the ceiling.** Hugh: *"Domain specialist inside the AI company > AI specialist inside the bank."* You're not going to be a banker who uses AI. You're the AI strategist who unlocks the finance vertical.

### Target Audience (Prioritized)

1. **Enterprise AI strategy roles at LLM companies** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind. VP of Finance Strategy teams.
2. **AI-native fintech / startups** — Companies building vertical AI products for financial services. Hugh: these are acquisition targets for the big LLM companies.
3. **Enterprise go-to-market roles** — Solution architecture, AI strategy, customer-facing technical roles at AI companies.
4. **Financial institutions building AI teams** — Banks, hedge funds, asset managers hiring AI strategists who understand both sides.

## Design Reference Analysis

### OpenAI Developer Blog (`developers.openai.com/blog/`)

| Element | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Layout | Card grid — each post is a discrete visual unit with image, date, title, summary, and category tag |
| Typography | Clean sans-serif hierarchy. Titles are prominent; body text recedes. Generous line-height |
| Color | Neutral palette: white space dominant, dark text, minimal accent color. Content does the talking |
| Navigation | Layered: primary header → sidebar categories → topic tags. Keyboard-accessible search (`Cmd+K`) |
| Content density | Balanced — cards have breathing room but the grid is information-rich. No wasted space |
| Key takeaway | **Let the work speak.** No hero animations, no decorative flourishes. Every pixel serves content |

### Google DeepMind Blog (`deepmind.google/blog/`)

| Element | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Layout | Card-based with generous whitespace. Featured post gets hero treatment (large image + headline) |
| Typography | Bold section headings, moderate-weight article titles. Spacing creates hierarchy, not font size |
| Color | Light background, dark text. Brand colors appear strategically, not decoratively |
| Navigation | Mega-menu with primary categories (Models, Research, Science, About). Footer mirrors header |
| Content density | Whitespace as a design element. Each section is a distinct visual block with clear boundaries |
| Key takeaway | **Hierarchy through space, not noise.** Fewer elements, each given room to breathe |

### Design Principles to Apply

1. **Content-first layout.** No decorative elements that don't serve the reader. Remove anything that exists purely for aesthetics.
2. **Card-based project display.** Each project is a self-contained unit: title, one-sentence summary, category tag, optional image. Scannable in under 3 seconds.
3. **Generous whitespace.** Section padding of 60-80px. Card spacing of 24-32px. Let the content breathe.
4. **Muted palette with one accent.** Dark background (`rgb(20, 22, 34)` for dark mode), off-white text (`#e0e0e0`, not pure white), single accent color for CTAs and links.
5. **Typography hierarchy through weight, not size.** Headings: 700 weight. Body: 400 weight. Same or similar font size. Line height 1.6-1.8.
6. **No hero animations or transitions.** Static, confident, information-dense. The hero section states who you are and what you do — nothing more.
7. **Category tags on every content card.** Enables scanning by recruiter interest (AI, Quantitative Finance, Engineering).

## What Top AI Labs Actually Hire For

Based on public hiring criteria and recruiter insights from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind:

### Anthropic's Hiring Philosophy

> "If you have done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the TOP of your resume."

- **No PhD required** — approximately 50% of technical staff do not have PhDs
- **Direct evidence of ability** over conventional credentials
- **Mission alignment** screened from the first conversation
- Engineers do research; researchers do engineering — the boundary has dissolved
- Public artifacts (blog posts, open-source, independent research) are weighted heavily

### OpenAI's Hiring Signals

- Prior research experience, top-tier portfolios, or open-source contributions
- Original thinking and real-world ML work demonstrated through public artifacts
- Global top 1% talent pool — but they hire rising stars who demonstrate depth
- Forward-deployed engineers who bridge AI systems and business problems

### What This Means for the Portfolio

The site must function as a **public artifact** — not a resume wrapper, but standalone proof of:

1. **End-to-end execution.** Projects that go from problem definition to deployed solution, not notebooks that stop at training.
2. **Original thinking.** Blog posts with genuine opinions and novel analysis, not summaries of existing content.
3. **Quantified business impact.** Every project should answer: "So what?" with specific metrics.
4. **System-level reasoning.** Architecture diagrams, trade-off analysis, failure modes — not just "I used GPT-4."
5. **Production awareness.** Latency, cost, monitoring, error handling — signals that you build for the real world.

---

## Content Strategy

### Project Selection Criteria

Every project on the site must pass three filters:

| Filter | Question | Fail example |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Relevance** | Would an AI lab or quant fund care? | Personal to-do app |
| **Depth** | Does it show system-level thinking? | "I fine-tuned a model on Hugging Face" with no analysis |
| **Impact** | Is there a measurable outcome? | "Interesting experiment" with no before/after |

### Recommended Project Types (Ranked by Signal Strength)

1. **AI systems for financial services** — RAG pipelines for financial documents, LLM agents for investment analysis, AI-powered compliance tools. The intersection of your two strongest domains.
2. **Enterprise AI case studies** — How a specific financial institution would adopt LLMs. Hugh: *"Identify problems inside the bank and propose a tiny solution for one or two of them."* This is the capstone AND the portfolio piece.
3. **Quantitative research frameworks** — Signal evaluation, backtesting, risk modeling. Show statistical rigor (walk-forward analysis, multiple testing correction). CFA + code = rare.
4. **Production AI systems** — RAG pipelines, LLM agents, inference optimization. Show latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs. Lead with the MathWorks pipeline work.
5. **Open-source contributions** — Meaningful PRs to established ML/AI repos. Link directly to the code.

### Blog Post Strategy

Blog posts are the highest-leverage content for Anthropic-style hiring.

**What to write:**
- **Enterprise AI adoption analysis.** "Why banks can't just plug in an LLM — and what the integration actually looks like."
- **AI × finance deep dives.** Architecture trade-offs for deploying LLMs in regulated environments. Compliance, trust, safety.
- **Contrarian takes backed by evidence.** "Everyone's building AI copilots for analysts. Here's why the real value is in back-office automation."
- **Quantitative breakdowns.** "I tested 5 chunking strategies on financial documents — here's what worked."
- **Go-to-market analysis.** "How LLM companies should sell to financial institutions." Hugh: this IS the strategy document that gets you hired.

**What NOT to write:**
- Tutorial-style content that summarizes documentation
- "Here's how I learned X" posts without original analysis
- Opinion pieces without supporting evidence or code
- Content that reads like a LinkedIn post
- Generic AI think pieces that don't connect to enterprise finance

### Publishing Cadence

- **Projects:** 3-5 strong case studies, added as completed (not rushed)
- **Posts:** 1 post per 2-3 weeks during active publishing periods. Quality over frequency.
- **Each post should link to a project** via frontmatter `projects` field — creates a network of evidence

## Content Style Guide

### Writing Principles

1. **Lead with the result.** "Improved retrieval accuracy from 62% to 96%" before explaining how.
2. **Quantify everything.** Specific numbers, percentages, latency measurements, cost per query.
3. **Show trade-offs.** "Accuracy increased 34% but latency rose from 2.1s to 3.4s — acceptable for enterprise use cases where correctness is critical."
4. **No filler.** Every sentence carries information. Cut "passionate about," "leveraging," "cutting-edge."
5. **Code speaks.** Include real code snippets — not pseudocode, not screenshots.

### Project Case Study Structure

Use consistently across all projects:

```
## Problem
What was broken or missing? (1-2 paragraphs)

## Approach
What did you build? Architecture decisions + trade-offs. (2-3 paragraphs)

## Technical Stack
Bullet list of tools. Include a representative code snippet.

## Results
Table with measurable before/after metrics.

## Key Insight
One takeaway that demonstrates depth. (1 paragraph)
```

**Summary field** (homepage card): One sentence, outcome-first.
> "End-to-end RAG system that improved document Q&A accuracy by 34% through hybrid search, dynamic chunking, and re-ranking pipelines."

### Blog Post Structure

- **Title:** Specific and opinionated. "Why Most RAG Systems Fail" > "Thoughts on RAG"
- **Opening:** Core thesis in the first 2 sentences
- **Body:** Clear H2 headings. Include code, math, tables where they add clarity
- **Length:** 800-1500 words. Dense, not padded
- **Closing:** Concrete takeaway, not a generic "in conclusion"

### Tags & Categories

Consistent taxonomy across all content:

| Type | Values |
|------|--------|
| **Tags** (specific) | `Enterprise AI`, `RAG`, `Python`, `LLM`, `Financial Services`, `Agentic AI`, `Go-to-Market`, `Quantitative Finance` |
| **Categories** (broad) | `Enterprise AI Strategy`, `AI Systems`, `Financial Services` |

## Task Items

### Phase 0: Foundation

Immediate tasks to make the site functional and presentable.

- [ ] **Add avatar photo.** Place a professional headshot as `content/authors/admin/avatar.jpg`. The About section renders a placeholder without it.
- [ ] **Add prior education.** Edit `content/authors/admin/_index.md` → `education.courses` to include undergrad degree.
- [ ] **Verify GitHub Pages source.** Confirm Repository Settings → Pages → Source is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from branch").
- [ ] **Verify Cloudflare DNS.** Confirm CNAME record: `twyoon.com` → `tyoon10.github.io`. SSL mode: Full.
- [ ] **Test live deployment.** Push current state, confirm https://twyoon.com loads with the new layout.

### Phase 1: Core Content

The minimum viable portfolio. Prioritized by recruiter impact. Irene: *"The best value you can bring is landing somewhere awesome."*

- [x] **Write MathWorks AI pipeline case study.** The RAG/AI pipeline built for Prof. Robbins. Irene's direct feedback: *"I don't care that you presented. I care that you built this AI pipeline."* Lead with "Built a novel AI pipeline that transforms unstructured data into a queryable graph vector database." Include technical details (RAG, graph vector DB, alpha-generating strategies). The 200+ audience and conference are results, not the headline. Place in `content/project/ai-pipeline-quant-finance/index.md`.
- [ ] **Write Concat Inc. co-founder case study.** AI-native fintech for insurance analytics. Frame as 0→1 product building: validated PMF through user research, built ML-powered recommendation engine (2x conversion), led strategic acquisition. Addresses the founder experience gap that 5/18 target JDs explicitly value. Place in `content/project/ai-fintech-cofounder/index.md`.
- [ ] **Write Anthropic go-to-market case study.** Frame Claude Ambassador work as enterprise go-to-market execution: 0→600+ community growth, enterprise-focused workshops, NYC hackathon with sponsors. This is product marketing evidence, not club leadership. Note: avoid "Lead" in title — Irene's feedback: in tech, "Lead" implies 10+ years. Let the work description carry the weight. Place in `content/project/claude-enterprise-gtm/index.md`.
- [ ] **Write first blog post: enterprise AI + finance thesis.** Connect to the capstone research direction. Example: "How LLM companies will eat the financial services application layer" or "What banks actually need from AI — and why most AI companies get it wrong." This becomes a preview of your capstone thinking and a conversation starter with hiring managers. Place in `content/post/<name>/index.md`.
- [ ] **Add featured images to projects.** Architecture diagrams or clean screenshots. Not stock photos.
- [ ] **Review and push.** Preview with `hugo server`, verify all sections render, push to deploy.

### Phase 2: Design Refinement

Align the visual design closer to the OpenAI/DeepMind reference standard.

- [ ] **Refine dark mode palette.** In `assets/scss/custom.scss`, adjust:
  - Background: ensure `rgb(20, 22, 34)` carries through all sections (not just hero)
  - Text: use `#e0e0e0` (off-white) instead of pure `#fff` to reduce eye strain
  - Accent: single color for all CTAs and links (current theme accent or a custom one)
  ```scss
  .dark {
    --tw-text-color: #e0e0e0;
    a { color: var(--primary-color); }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Increase whitespace.** Adjust section padding in `content/_index.md`:
  - Hero: `["100px", "0", "100px", "0"]` (from 80px)
  - Other sections: `["60px", "0", "60px", "0"]` (from 40px)
  - This matches the spacious feel of DeepMind's blog

- [ ] **Refine typography weight hierarchy.** In `custom.scss`:
  ```scss
  .home-section .section-heading h1 {
    font-weight: 600;  /* Down from 700 — less "shouting" */
    font-size: 1.5rem; /* Down from 1.75rem — closer to OpenAI's understated style */
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Add category tags to project cards.** Ensure every project has visible `tags` in frontmatter. The card view renders these as filterable labels — matches the OpenAI pattern of tag-based scanning.

- [ ] **Constrain content width.** Add to `custom.scss`:
  ```scss
  .home-section .container {
    max-width: 800px; /* Matches optimal reading width */
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Review card density.** If more than 4 projects: switch project collection to `columns: "2"` for a grid. If 1-3 projects: keep `columns: "1"` for full-width cards with more detail visible.

### Phase 3: Expansion

Additional sections and pages.

- [ ] **Build Events page.** Create `content/event/` section:
  1. Create directory: `content/event/`
  2. Create template: `content/event/_template/index.md` with frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: "Event Title"
     summary: "Short description"
     date: 2026-03-15
     date_end: 2026-03-15
     location: "Columbia University, NYC"
     authors: [admin]
     tags: [AI, Workshop]
     image:
       focal_point: Smart
     links:
       - icon: link
         icon_pack: fas
         name: Registration
         url: https://example.com
     draft: true
     ---
     ```
  3. Add collection block to `content/_index.md` (between Posts and Contact):
     ```yaml
     - block: collection
       id: events
       content:
         title: Events
         subtitle: ""
         count: 5
         filters:
           folders:
             - event
         sort_by: Date
         sort_ascending: false
       design:
         view: compact
         columns: "2"
         spacing:
           padding: ["60px", "0", "60px", "0"]
     ```
  4. Add nav link in `hugo.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     - name: Events
       url: '#events'
       weight: 25
     ```

- [ ] **Add Resume/CV page.** Options:
  - **Option A:** Downloadable PDF. Place `static/resume.pdf` and add a link.
  - **Option B:** Dedicated Hugo page using HugoBlox's `resume-biography`, `resume-experience`, and `resume-skills` blocks. More maintainable but more work to set up.
  - **Recommendation:** Start with Option A (fast), build Option B later if the site becomes your primary resume format.

- [ ] **Capstone case study (the anchor piece).** Hugh's recommendation: a deep case study on how AI/LLMs solve specific problems inside a financial institution. "Identify different problems inside the bank and propose a solution for one or two of them." This becomes both the capstone deliverable and the strongest portfolio piece — and the strategy document you'd share in an interview. Place in `content/project/enterprise-ai-finance-case-study/index.md`.

- [ ] **Write 2-3 additional blog posts.** Suggested topics aligned to enterprise AI × finance positioning:
  - "What enterprise AI adoption actually looks like inside a bank" — from your conversations and research
  - "The agentic AI opportunity in financial services" — leverages Manus AI fellow experience
  - "Why the LLM companies will win the finance application layer" — the Hugh Thomas thesis, backed by your evidence

- [ ] **Write 1-2 additional project case studies.** Fill out the portfolio to 4-5 total. Aim for coverage:
  - Enterprise AI products for finance (targets AI lab finance strategy roles)
  - Agentic AI systems (targets Anthropic, Manus AI audience)
  - Quantitative/statistical work (targets quant funds, shows CFA-level rigor)

### Phase 4: Distribution

Make the site discoverable and trackable.

- [ ] **Enable Google Analytics.** Add your GA4 measurement ID to `hugo.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  googleAnalytics: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
  ```

- [ ] **SEO basics.** Ensure every project and post has:
  - A unique `title` (under 60 characters)
  - A `summary` (under 160 characters) — this becomes the meta description
  - Relevant `tags` for topic clustering

- [ ] **Open Graph images.** HugoBlox auto-generates OG images from `featured.jpg` in each content folder. Ensure all published content has one for proper link previews on LinkedIn/Twitter.

- [ ] **Cross-link from LinkedIn.** Update LinkedIn profile to link to twyoon.com. Add the URL to the "Featured" section on LinkedIn with a brief description.

- [ ] **Submit to Google Search Console.** Verify ownership and submit the sitemap (`twyoon.com/sitemap.xml`) for indexing.

- [ ] **Enable site search (optional).** Set `params.header.navbar.show_search: true` in `hugo.yaml`. Useful once content volume grows past 10+ pages.
